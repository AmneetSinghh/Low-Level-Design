1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.  (seperate them then use them using composition)
2. We use composition for above case, so We pass behavior in runtime using constructor invocation.
3. Expose only interfaces to outer world, because with interfaces we can only expose the functions that we want the outer world to use.
4. With interface exposing our code is well abstracted, client don't know about internal details.
