Important points:
1. used object composition to wrap the adaptee with an altered interface. Advantage we can pass any subclass of an adaptee
2. pattern binds client to an interface not an implementation, we can use several adapters to bind different duck implementations to
different tuckey ducks. So client never knows we are using new interface example turkey duck.
3. convert one interface to another.
4. When new interface isn't compatable with your code, Make use of adapter pattern.
