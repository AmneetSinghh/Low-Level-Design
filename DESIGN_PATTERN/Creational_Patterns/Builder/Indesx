1. Disadvantage of Multiple setter methods is :

    - Object can have a inconsistent state, while setting methods. if we have 10-20 setter methods, then

    House house = new House()
    house.set
    house.set
    house.set ...
    /..
    20 times. if all below not ran then there is a issue.

    - if setter logic is different for every different house represenatation example :
    - igglo house
    - morning house. then this simple setters will not work.....
