1. Level cache follows chain-of-responsibility
    - each level has their own responsiblity, just we need to add levels in a chain.

Good Design practices :

1. Use heavy composition
2. For removing null checks, make class, that has nullClass which will have response if something null
3. make use final where we don't want the variable to change once after initilized ( immutable things )
4. make every varaible FINAL and do use @nonNull annotations.
